        <p>The scatter plot above illustrates the strong relationship between state disability rates and people's activity limitations.
            As we can see, there is a strong correlation (0.7703) in this data -- suggesting that state disability
            rates play a material role in citizens' ability to have sustained physical activity. Since lack of physical 
            activity leads to health ailments such as obesity and heart disease, it behooves us to futher investigate the causes of the leading disabilities reported. With this
            strong of a correlation, we might expect to see a more active population as disability rates decrease. </p>

        <p>**Interesting Note** : Puerto Rico reports the highest disability rate, however also has among
            the lowest reported rates of limited physical activity due to those disabilites. Puerto Ricans don't seem to
            let their health problems hold them back!</p>
